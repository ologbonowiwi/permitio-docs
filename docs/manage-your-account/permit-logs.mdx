<p className="intro-paragraph">The Permit.io Logs provides comprehensive auditing of all administrative actions and changes made within your workspace, allowing you to track who made what changes and when.
These logs are essential for security, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes, giving you complete visibility into both dashboard activities and API-level changes across your permission management system. </p>


## Activity Logs

The activity log screen shows the Permit.io internal audit log - **who did what** within your Permit.io workspace.
This log will only show changes made via the Permit.io dashboard.
If you wish to see changes made via the Permit.io REST API, you should check out the API log.

To view the activity log, go to the **Settings screen** on the Sidebar and select the **Activity Log** tab.

:::info
Only workspace owners may view activity logs.

If you cannot see this screen, contact the workspace owner (typically the person who opened the account).

### Searching and filtering activity logs

To pinpoint a particular activity in the log carried out by a team member, simply refine your search by selecting the
specific date of the action and/or filtering by the individual who made the changes. This targeted approach ensures
that tracking and reviewing internal operations remain both efficient and thorough, enhancing accountability within the team.

This screen enables filtering requests by response type and source. The available filter options are for these sources:

- API Log: Requests sent via API endpoints rather than through the user interface
- UI: Requests originating from your user interface
- Element: Requests sent from the Element component embedded in the your system
