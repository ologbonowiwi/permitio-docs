<p className="intro-paragraph">Ownership plays an important role in managing and securing access to resources - this guide explains how to setup ownership using Permit </p>

---

As we always want to ensure that data owned by a user is accessible to them and to those given the privilege by them, ownership is on of the first building block of fine-grained authorization.

There are two primary methods that can be employed to model ownership of resources -
Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC).
Both approaches offer unique advantages and cater to different requirements for managing access controls.

Let's take a look at a simple example:

:::tip Example
`Bob`, a user in our system, needs to have access to his own files based on his ownership of them.
:::

There are two possible ways to create policies that would enforce `Bob`'s ownership of his files:

:::noteRBAC based Ownership
Technically, it is possible to setup ownership by using roles. Using roles for ownership, we would need to set up access per user and per resource - making it highly inefficient and unscalable.
:::

## ABAC

ABAC utilizes **attributes** as the basis for access control decisions. These attributes can be associated with users, resources, or the environment.
In the context of granting a user access to files based on ownership, ABAC involves adding an `Owner` attribute to each file and folder.
The user is then granted a role that permits them access to any file or folder where the `Owner` attribute matches their ID.

:::

### Pros & Cons

While offering a very granular way of managing ownership on a per-resouce level, ABAC lacks the ability to rely on existing application-level relationships (Such as a file residing within a folder).
This can result in a rather meticulous ownership assignment process only fit for specific scenarios.

### Setting up ABAC based Ownership in Permit

:::tip Example Policy
For the purpose of this example, let's try and setup the following policy:
`Bob` can `Read`, `Upadte`, and `Delete` every file he is an `Owner` of.  
:::

To setup an ABAC based ownership policy in Permit's UI -

1. Login to your Permit account at app.permit.io
2. For the purpose of this tutorial, we setup a resource called `File` and a role called `User` in advance.
3. Go to the `Resources` tab under `Policy`. Locate your resource, and click "Add Attributes".
   ![Add Attributes](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/1.png)
4. In the resource editor, under `ABAC Options`, click on `Add Attribute`.
   ![Resource Editor](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/2.png)
5. Name the attribute, and set it as a string. Click save.
   ![Add Attribute](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/3.png)
6. Go to the `ABAC Rules` tab, and enable ABAC Options.
7. Create the following ABAC Resource Set:
   ![Resource Set](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/4.png)
8. Go back to the policy editor screen. You should now be able to see a new file-ownership resource set you can manage the permissions for.

The ABAC condition will compare the file_ownership attribute (On the resource) is equal to the `user.key` of the user trying to perform the action.

## ReBAC

ReBAC allows us to implement ownership in a more effective way by leveraging existing application-level relationships and creating simple policies based on hierarchies and groupings.

By creating Parent-Child hierarchies, ReBAC allows us to nest resources under other resources.
Such a relationship allows us to derive roles based on the relationship between two resources:

:::tip Example
![ReBAC Example](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/6.png)
:::

The ReBAC policy for this graph will look like this:

A user who is assigned the role `Folder#Owner` will also be assigned the `File#Owner` when the `Folder` instance is the `Parent` of a `File` instance.

In simpler words, if a file resides inside a folder (Thatâ€™s the Parent-Child relationship), and a user is assigned the owner of that folder, they will also be the owner of the files.

### Pros & Cons

While providing the obvious benefit of managing hierarchical ownership scenarios, ReBAC might be a little more complex to model.

### Setting up ReBAC based Ownership with Permit

:::tip Example Policy
For the purpose of this example, let's use the same one from before:
`Bob` can `Read`, `Upadte`, and `Delete` every file he is an `Owner` of.  
:::

To setup a ReBAC based ownership policy in Permit's UI -

1. Login to your Permit account at app.permit.io
2. For the purpose of this tutorial, we setup a resource called `File`, a resource called `Folder`, and a role called `User` in advance.
3. In the `Policy` section, go to the `Resources` tab. Click on `Add Roles`.
   ![Resource Editor](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/7.png)
4. Under "ReBAC Options", add a resource role named "owner" to both the `File` and `Folder` resources. In the `Folder` resource, add the following relation:
   ![ReBAC Options](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/8.png)
5. In the `Direcrory` section, click on `Add User`. Create a new user who you want to give access to the specific file instance.
   In our case, we created a user named `Bob` and gave him the recource role `Bobs_Files#owner`.
   ![ReBAC Options](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/9.png)
6. Go to the `Policy` section and click on `Resource instances`. Click on `Add instance` and fill out the form. This will create our file instance, adding the relationships to it.
   ![ReBAC Options](/ui-videos/how-to/ownership/10.png)
7. Going back to the `Policy Editor` screen, you will be able to see the `file#owner` role and the `folder#owner` role.
   As `file` is set as parent of `folder`, all permissions set on a `folder` will automatically propogate to `files` within those folders as well.
