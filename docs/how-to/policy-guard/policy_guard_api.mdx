<p className="intro-paragraph">The Policy Guard API allows you to manage policies at the organization level.
Policy Guards help enforce centralized control over permissions and roles across specific projects included in the policy. </p>

For example, let's say you want to ensure that only admins can create documents, while all other roles are restricted to read-only access.
To achieve this, you would create a Policy Guard that defines these permissions, assigning the "admin" role the ability to create documents,
while restricting the "viewer" role to read-only access.
This policy would then apply consistently across all projects included in the Policy Guard.
Let's see how you can use the [Policy Guard API](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Policy-Guards-(EAP)) for the example above.

:::note Info
For more information on Policy Guards, see the [Policy Guard documentation](/how-to/policy-guard/policy_guard).

## Example API Usage

**First, we'll create a new policy guard scope in order to define the scope of the policy guard.**

### Create a New Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
 key":   "policy_guard_acme",
         "org_id": "c3b6f5d7-8b1e-4c6d-9e9f-8c9d6f8e0c8f",
         "policy_guard_scope_details": [
             {
                 "proj_id": "c3b6f5d7-8b1e-4c6d-9e9f-8c9d6f8e0c8f",
             }]
}'
```

**To retrieve details about a specific policy guard scope, use the scope's ID. This allows you to confirm its settings and ensure it's correctly configured.**

### Get a Policy Guard Scope by ID
```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
```

**If you need to remove a policy guard scope, you can delete it by specifying its ID. This will remove all associated permissions and roles.**

### Delete a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
```

**To extend the policy guard to include a new project, you can associate it with the existing policy guard scope.**

### Assign a Project to a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/associate' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "project_id": "c3b6f5d7-8b1e-4c6d-9e9f-8c9d6f8e0c8f"
}'
```

**If a project is no longer part of the policy guard, you can disassociate it by providing the project's detail. This will remove the project's permissions defined in the scope.**

### Remove a Project from a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/disassociate' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "project_id": "c3b6f5d7-8b1e-4c6d-9e9f-8c9d6f8e0c8f"
}'
```

**For adding and removing permission rules, you need to provide the resource, role, action, and whether the action is allowed or not.**

### Add a Permission Rule to a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/rules' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "resource_key": "documents",
    "role_key": "admin",
    "action_key": "create",
    "is_allowed": true
}'
```
:::note Info
The `resource_key`, `role_key`, and `action_key` are unique identifiers for resources, roles, and actions.
We use `key` to create and guard objects, as IDs are unique within each environment.
:::

**For adding ABAC rules, you can provide user set and resource set**

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/rules' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "resource_key": "documents",
    "user_set": {
        "key": "user_set_email",
        "attribute": "email",
        "values": "permit",
        "operator": "contains"
    },
    "action_key": "create",
    "is_allowed": true
}'
```
:::note Info
Using ABAC rules, you can define user and resource sets to guard permissions based on their attributes.
For locking a user set, specify the user set, resource, and action.
For locking a resource set, specify the resource set, resource, action, and either a role or user set.

For exemple, if you will try to create rule with user set and role key, it will throw an error.
:::


**If you need to revoke permissions for a specific action, you can remove the corresponding permission rule. This is how you would revoke the "admin" role's ability to create documents.**

### Remove a Permission Rule from a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/rules' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
--data-raw '{
    "resource_key": "documents",
    "role_key": "admin",
    "action_key": "create",
}'
```

**To view all permission rules associated with a specific policy guard scope, you can retrieve them using the scope's ID. This helps in auditing and understanding the current permissions in place.**

### List all Permission Rules for a Policy Guard Scope
```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/policy_guards/scopes/{policy_guard_scope_id}/rules' \
-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY'
```
