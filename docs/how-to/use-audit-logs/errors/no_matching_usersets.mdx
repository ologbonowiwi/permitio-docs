title: No matching user sets found for the given user and attributes
---

<p className="intro-paragraph">This error surfaced because the user you are attempting to verify does not have any associated User Sets. Essentially, the user attributes
you're submitting either in the check or within the Permit database do not align with any User Sets established in the Permit web
application. </p>

You can view and manage the User Sets you have crafted in the [Policy Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor),
where you'll also have the option to modify a User Set and review its conditions.

## A Solution to the issue

To resolve this, you have two options: either send the correct user attributes or establish a User Set that aligns with the user
attributes you are defining.

### Sending the correct user attributes

Ensure that the necessary user attributes are stored in the Permit DB if you are utilizing it. You can verify this information through the
[User Management Screen](https://app.permit.io/user-management) in the Permit web application or by utilizing the
[Get User](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Users/operation/get_user) API Call.

If you're inputting the attributes via the `permit.check()`, double-check that you're sending the correct attributes.

### Creating a User Set that matches the user attributes

You can create a User Set that matches the user attributes using [Policy management screen](https://app.permit.io/policy-editor) in
the Permit web application.

You can also create a User Set with the [Create User Set](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Condition-Sets/operation/create_condition_set) API call.
