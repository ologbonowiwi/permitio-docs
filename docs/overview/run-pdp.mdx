description: Run your PDP locally to have the Authorization engine test your permissions.

<p className="intro-paragraph">Permit provides you with a [Policy Decision Point](/overview/how-does-it-work#the-policy-decision-point-pdp),
which functions as your microservice for authorization. The PDP is provided as a docker container ready for you to use,
or as a cloud version for quick experimentation. </p>

Please follow the steps below to **install** and **run** the container on your local machine.

### Pulling PDP container from Docker Hub

If you do not have Docker installed as of yet, **[click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** to install Docker.

```
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

### Running the container

Remember to **replace** `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the **API Key** you obtained.

```
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_DEBUG=True --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

:::info
Congratulations! You should now have a PDP container running. You can always check the status of the container
by typing `docker ps` in your terminal.

<TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud PDP">

It is extremely simple to utilize the cloud PDP. As part of the initialization of the Permit instance, you need to pass
the cloud PDP URL.

:::warning REMEMBER
The cloud PDP is great for quick experimentation with Permit, to learn how the service works, and to quickly integrate the SDK.

In **production deployments**, it is best to deploy the **Docker Container PDP** for better latency and availability.

For time being, the **Cloud PDP is NOT compatible** with Attribute-based Access Control policies **(ABAC)**
** and also Relationship-based Access Control **(ReBAC)\*\* policies.

:::

```js
// This line initializes the SDK and connects your app
// to the Permit.io Cloud PDP.

const permit = new Permit({
  pdp: "https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",
});
```

</TabItem>
