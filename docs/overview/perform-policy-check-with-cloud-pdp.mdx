<p className="intro-paragraph">Performing your first **policy check** is a key step in understanding and validating the policies youâ€™ve configured.
The policy decision point (PDP) lies at the heart of Permitâ€™s Authorization system, determining whether a user is authorized
to perform specific actions on a resource. This ensures that your access control model is working as intended. </p>

## Before we start: Understanding the check function

The check function acts as a guard at the heart of your applicationâ€™s access control system. It evaluates whether a specific user
has the necessary permissions to **perform an action on a resource**, ensuring that only authorized users can proceed. By taking key
parameters such as the `user ID`, `action`, and `resource`, the check function queries the policy engine to return a decision.

> What exactly are the arguments passed into the `permit.check()` function?

- **`user`**: a unique string id or object that identifies the user performing the action.
- **`action`**: the action performed.
- **`resource`**: the resource (object) the action is performed on. Can be a string or an object.

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/check-function" />

> This guard mechanism is critical for enforcing your configured policies and seamlessly integrating authorization into your
> applicationâ€™s workflows.

:::note
The check function can accept various arguments beyond the user and resource.

## Using the cloud PDP to run our first check

To perform our first policy check, we need to identify an enforcement point in our codeâ€”this is where the check function comes into
play. For this example, weâ€™ll build up on the policy configured in our [first walkthrough](/overview/configure-your-first-rbac-policy).

Below is the policy weâ€™ll be working with. As shown, the `Admin` role has permissions to `create, delete, publish, and read`,
but notably, it does not have permission to `update`.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/permissions-false.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

We also have two users in our setup, but only one of them has the Admin role assigned. For this example, weâ€™ll focus on checking the
permissions assigned to Macy Smith, who holds the Admin role.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/users-and-roles.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

Our Permit enforcement point in the code will look like this:

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/check-function-false" />

Let's run it.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/audit-log-fail.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

Now let's alter our permissions, and lets give Macy the permissions to `update` the `Document`.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/permissions-true.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/check-function-true" />

Hurray, Macy can now perform all the actions!

/>

:::warning
Cloud PDP is limited to RBAC policies only, with 1MB data restriction. For ABAC / ReBAC policies, you need to deploy a local PDP.

For production deployments, we recommend deploying a local PDP to minimize network latency and ensure high availability.

## Running a local PDP

A Policy Decision Point (PDP) is the component responsible for making authorization decisions based on defined policies.
While the default Cloud PDP provides a seamless, managed experience, performing a local policy check unlocks additional benefits
like speed, security, and extensibility.

Running a local policy check is almost identical to using the Cloud PDP. The key difference lies in the Permit object initialization,
which connects to your locally hosted PDP instead of the cloud service.

### Pull the PDP Docker Container

Permit.io provides the PDP as a ready-to-use Docker container. Start by pulling the latest version from Docker Hub:

```js
docker pull permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<Video src={pullPDP} controls />

:::note
If Docker is not yet installed on your system, [click here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) to install Docker.
:::

### Run the Docker Container

Once the container is pulled, you can run the PDP locally. Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the Secret Key you obtained from Permit.io.

```js
docker run -it -p 7766:7000 --env PDP_DEBUG=True --env PDP_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY> permitio/pdp-v2:latest
```

<Video src={runPDP} controls />

<br />
<br />

> The container will expose the PDP on `localhost:7766`, ready to handle authorization requests.

## Initialize the Permit object

After setting up the Local PDP, you can integrate it into your application to handle authorization checks. The process is almost
identical to using the Cloud PDP, with one key difference: pointing to the local PDP URL during initialization.

When initializing the Permit object in your application, point it to the locally hosted PDP:

<CodeBlock folderPath="/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/local-pdp-obj" />

</TimelineStep>
<TimelineStep>

## Perform the authorization check

Perform authorization checks as you normally would. The Local PDP will seamlessly handle policy validation. We will use the same
policy configuration as in our first policy check from the previous walkthrough.

We have a policy configured for the `Admin` role.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/basic-policy.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

We have `Macy Smith` as our user for this policy check. She has been assigned the `Admin` role.

<img
  src="/img/updated/walkthroughs/first-policy-check/user-directory.png"
  alt="Copy secret key from user menu"
  data-zoomable
/>

We have identified the enforcement point where we will check if Macy has the **permission** to `create` a `document`.

```js
const permitted = permit.check("user|987654321", "create", "document");
```

## What did you learn?

By configuring the Cloud PDP for policy checks, youâ€™ve learned how to:

- Import and initialize the Permit SDK in your project.
- Set up an enforcement point in your code using the check function.
- Validate user permissions against your configured policies in real time.
- Leverage the flexibility of the Cloud PDP to handle RBAC policy decisions seamlessly.

:::tip FUN FACT!
Did you know that modern policy checks can process **thousands of decisions per second**?

Companies like Netflix use similar mechanisms
to authorize every single request in their systemsâ€”whether itâ€™s playing a movie or accessing account settings.
