title: Configure your first RBAC Policy
---

<p className="intro-paragraph">**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a method for managing access to resources by assigning permissions based on user
roles. It simplifies security management by ensuring users only have access to what they need to perform their job. For a
deeper dive into RBAC and its benefits, explore our detailed [blog post](https://www.permit.io/blog/what-is-rbac) or check out our
[Permit RBAC home page](https://www.permit.io/rbac) to learn more. </p>

In this guide, you'll learn how to configure your first RBAC policy, step by stepâ€”starting with creating roles, defining
resources and actions, and assigning roles to users.

## Creating your first role

The first step in configuring your RBAC policy is to define roles, which represent a set of permissions associated with
specific actions and resources. Roles are the foundation of RBAC, as they determine what a user can or cannot do within
the system.

In this example, we will create a role called **Admin**, which typically represents a user with the highest level of access.

> Make sure the name is **clear** and **meaningful**, reflecting the purpose of the role.
> You can also pass a `key` to uniquely identify a role and a `description` to offer a more meaningful explanation of the role.

To **create the Admin** role:

1. Navigate to the Policy Screen
2. Click `Create a Role`
3. Enter "Admin" as the name of the role.

## Creating a resource and its actions

1. Navigate to the `Policy` Screen.
2. Click `Create a Resource`.
3. Enter `Document` as the name of the resource. Ensure the name clearly represents the entity or object in your system requiring
   controlled access, such as a **file**, **database entry**, or, in this case, a **document**.
4. Add the actions associated with this resource. Start with Permitâ€™s basic pre-defined actions â€” `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`
   (CRUD). These actions cover fundamental operations common across most systems.
5. Optionally, add **custom actions** to reflect specific operations relevant to your use case. For example, add a custom action called
   `publish`, representing an operation specific to document management.

:::note
This combination of predefined and bespoke actions gives you flexibility in crafting access policies tailored to
your applicationâ€™s needs.

## Configuring RBAC permissions in the Policy editor

Now, with our roles and resources in place, we need to define the exact permissions for the Admin role.
This is done in the Policy Editor, where you can specify what actions each role is allowed to perform on a given resource.

1. Navigate to the `Policy Editor` Screen.
2. **Find** the `Admin` role, and the `Document` resource underneath the role.
3. Tick the **actions** the Admin role can perform on the Document resource:
   - `create`
   - `read`
   - `publish` (the custom action defined earlier).

By mapping specific actions to roles in the Policy Editor, you ensure your access control model is both secure and flexible, tailored
to your application's requirements.

## Add a user and assign a role

Finally, now that weâ€™ve defined a role, a resource, and its associated permissions, itâ€™s time to **bring a user into the system** and
grant them access.

:::tip
A users represent individuals or entities that will interact with your application, and roles determine
what they can do.
:::

1. Navigate to the `Directory` page.
2. Click `Add User`.
3. Enter `sam@permit.io` as the user's **email address**. Ensure the email corresponds to the individual who should receive access.
4. Assign the `Admin` role to this user by selecting it from the list of available roles. This grants the user full administrative
   permissions to manage resources and perform all actions defined for the role.

Once this step is complete, your RBAC setup is ready, and the Admin role will have all the necessary permissions to
manage the Document resource effectively.

## What did you learn?

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve successfully configured your first **RBAC** policy by creating a role, defining a resource with
actions, assigning a user, and setting permissions. This foundational setup is the cornerstone of a secure and scalable
access control system.

:::tip FUN FACT!
RBAC is so effective that itâ€™s used by NASA to manage access to mission-critical systems! By leveraging roles and
permissions, they ensure that only authorized personnel can interact with sensitive spacecraft operations and data.
