title: Building Conditions
---

<p className="intro-paragraph">Conditions for an ABAC Policy can be very complex. We can have **many conditions in one group**, and several groups
working together to produce a rule. For both user sets and resource sets, conditions within a group are made
up of **attributes**, **attribute types** and **comparison operators**. Multiples of these can be joined together by logical operators
within each group. Groups can also be combined together with logical operators. </p>

## Condition Outline

Writing the API call payload, we start a condition definition by creating a key called **conditions** with an object as it's value.

```js
"conditions": {}
```

## Working with Logical Operators

Any of the logical operators below can be defined within the conditions object, where each of these take an array as a value.
Within the array we define sub-conditions that are made up of **attributes**, **attribute types** and **comparison operators**.

### allOf

The **allOf** operator only returns **true** if **condition A _AND_ B are true**.

:::info example
Only employees that are **located in the US** _**AND**_ have a **role of editor** can have access to resource X.
:::

```javascript
"conditions": {
    "allOf": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

### anyOf

The **anyOf** operator only returns **true** if **condition A _OR_ condition B** is true.

:::info example
Only students with a **maths score higher than 80%** _**OR**_ students with an **average of 60% from all subjects** can participate.
:::

```javascript
"conditions": {
    "anyOf": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

### not

The **not** operator returns the inverted result. If **condition A** is **false**, it will return true.

:::info example
If we go ahead and make a statement that says:

**"A user with the Editor role can only request changed to the document."**

will be reflected as:

**"An Editor can request changes to the document and any other available resources."**

:::

```javascript
"conditions": {
    "not": [
        ...
    ]
}
```

:::tip
It is **important to note** that when writing your conditions, you can **either** use the **alias versions** of the
logical operators **(allOf, anyOf)**, or the **normal verbose** version **(and, or)**.
:::

## Working with Comparison Operators

There are many ways to go about defining conditions within groups. Let's look at some examples, ones that are valid, and
others that are not. This will give you a good understanding of how conditions can be built and how complex they might get.

### Logical-First Conditions

#### VALID

```js
{
    "allOf": [
        {"subject.paying": {"equals": True}},
        {
            "anyOf": [
                {"subject.role": {"equals": "editor"}},
                {"subject.department": {"equals": "marketing"}},
            ]
        },
        {"environment.location": {"in": ["US", "Canada"]}},
    ]
}
```

#### INVALID

This version is invalid because the logical operator is invalid.

```js
{
    "all_of": [
        {"subject.paying": {"equals": True}},
        {
            "any_of": [
                {"subject.role": {"equals": "editor"}},
                {"subject.department": {"equals": "marketing"}},
            ]
        },
        {"environment.location": {"in": ["US", "Canada"]}},
    ]
}
```

#### VALID

```js
{
    "allOf": [
        {
            "subject.time": {
                "anyOf": [{"between": [9, 12]}, {"between": [13, 18]}]
            }
        },
        {
            "resource.weekday": {
                "not": {"anyOf": [{"equals": "saturday"}, {"equals": "sunday"}]}
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

#### INVALID

This example is invalid because we specify the **user.age** to be between 15 and 18, but then set
another condition to test for the age being greater than 48. This will throw an **Unbound Error**.

```js
{
    "or": [
        {"user.age": {"between": [15, 18]}},
        {"user.age": {"greater-than": 40}},
    ]
}
```

### Attribute-First Conditions

#### VALID

```js
{"subject.time": {"and": [{"between": [9, 12]}, {"equals": "13:00"}]}}
```

#### INVALID

This example is invalid because the conditional operator is invalid.

```js
{
    "user.age": {
        "or": [
            {"between": [15, 18]},
            {"greater-than-unsupported": 40},
        ]
    }
}
```

#### VALID

```js
{
    "user.age": {
        "or": [
            {"between": [15, 18]},
            {"greater-than": 40},
        ]
    }
}
```
