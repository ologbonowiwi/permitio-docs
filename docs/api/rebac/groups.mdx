<p className="intro-paragraph">The Groups API simplifies relationship-based permission management for your resource instances and users by using groups. Groups, as suggested by the name, group together resource instances and users, enabling you to assign group members with permissions on resource instances. </p>


## Key Features:

- **Create, Update, Delete, and List Groups**: The Groups API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to manage the lifecycle of your groups, ensuring you have complete control over their configuration and membership.

- **Assigning roles to Groups**: Groups can be assigned roles directly (instead of users). When adding users to a group through the API, you set them to automatically derive their permissions from the roles assigned to the group, ensuring consistent and manageable access control. See the [Groups API Redoc](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc#tag/Groups) for more information.

- **Group Resource Instances, and Users**: Organize your resource instances and users into groups, allowing for simplified ReBAC permissions for:

- **Users:** Including users in User Groups allows you to assign an entire cluster of users with a single role (Instead of assigning roles to each user individually). You can set a role assigned to the group to be automatically assigned to all its members and revoked once their membership is removed.

:::info How it Works:
Say we create a marketing group and assign a `member` role to it, we then assign users to the Group via a `member` role. The API then [derives](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/overview/#role-derivation) other roles based on this assignment (See example below)
:::

- **Resource Instances**: Grouping resources in a Resource Group enables you to manage access control for multiple resources simultaneously, ensuring all included resources share the same permission configuration.

:::info How it Works:
Following the previous example, we can create another group in our marketing group titled `social_media`. This group will contain resource instances of marketing materials. We can assign this newly created group the role of editor.
The Groups API creates an automatic derivation between the `social_media#editor` role and the `marketing#member` role - meaning all users with the `marketing#member` role will automatically be assigned with the `social_media#editor` role. New resources added to `social_media` will be accessible to edit by members of the marketing group, and new users added as members to the marketing group will automatically have editor access to social media assets.

## Example Usage for User Groups:

Let’s dive deeper into a simple use-case example for User Groups:

Say our company has several teams, each with a few employees assigned to each team. Our goal is to allow all members of the Marketing Team to Edit Social Media resources based on their group membership.

For this purpose, we will first create a group named `teams`. The group, `teams` is a resource, while each specific team (Such as `marketing-team`) is a resource instance.

Users are assigned to the `marketing-team` via the `member` role (The `member` role here is, of course, just an example. Feel free to customize roles as you wish).

As mentioned above, we also have a `social_media` resource, and a `training_video` - which is a resource instance of the `social_media` type. This resource instance supports the role `editor`.

Let’s set this up:

### API Calls: Create Group, Add Role to Group, Add Users to Group:


To **create a new group**, make a POST request with the following data:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
 --data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "marketing", "group_resource_type_key": "teams", "group_tenant": "default"}'
```

Create the `social_media` resource:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{proj_id}/{env_id}/resources' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
 --data-raw '{"key": "social_media", "name": "social media", "actions":{}}'
```

Create a `training_video` resource instance:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{proj_id}/{env_id}/resource_instances' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
 --data-raw '{"key": "training_video", "tenant": "business", "resource":"social_media"}'
```

Create a role called `editor`
```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{proj_id}/{env_id}/roles' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
 --data-raw '{"key": "editor", "name”: "editor"}'
```

Next, we assign the `editor` role to the `marketing-team` group instance:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/group/{group_resource_type_key}/roles' \
 -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
 --data-raw '{"resource": "social_media", "resource_instance": "training_video", "role": "editor", tenant:"business"}'
```

Finally, assign a user to the `marketing-team` group instance:

To **add users to a group**, make a PUT request with the following data:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups/{group_resource_type_key}/users/{user_id}' \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \
     --data-raw '{"tenant":"business"}'
```

### Automated Role Derivation:

Once we assign the `editor` role to `marketing-team` group instance,  the following will be automated by the API:


A role derivation will be created from `team#member` to `social_media#editor`
A relation will be created between the `teams` group and the `social_media` resource. The name of this relation will be `team_group`.
A relationship will be created between `teams#marketing-team` and `social_media#training_video`.
If a new user is assigned the member role on the `marketing-team` resource, they will automatically be assigned the editor role on the `social_media#training_video` instance.
Thus, every new `marketing-team` member will be able to edit the `social_media#training_video` resource instance.

## Example Usage for Resource Groups

Let’s dive deeper into a simple use-case example for Resource Groups:

Say we have a Group and inside the group, we have the Support team and Organization 1. Our goal is to allow all members of the Support Team to be members in Organization 1 and in all of his related instances.

For this purpose, we will first create a group named `Group`. The group, `group` is a resource, while each specific group inside (Such as `support-team`) is a resource instance.

Users are assigned to the `support-team` via the `member` role.

As mentioned above, we also have an `Org1` resource instance.
This resource instance supports the role of `member`.

Let’s set this up:

### API Calls: Create Group, Add Role to Group, Add Group to Group:

To **create a new group** with Group instance `support`, make a POST request with the following data:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups' \

-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \

--data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "support", "group_tenant": "default"}'

```

Create another Group instance `org1`:

```bash
curl 'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups' \

-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \

--data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "org1", "group_tenant": "default"}'
```

Now, we want to create a connection between those two group instances.

```bash
curl -X PUT \

'https://api.permit.io/v2/schema/{project_id}/{env_id}/groups/{group_instance_key}/assign_group' \

-H 'authorization: Bearer API_SECRET_KEY' \

--data-raw '{"group_instance_key": "org1"}'
```

Once we assign the `org1` group instance  to the `support` group instance, the following will be automated by the API:

- A role derivation will be created from group#member' to `group#member`
- A relation will be created between the `group` resource and the `group` resource. The name of this relation will be `group`.
- A relationship will be created between `group#support-team` and `group#org1`.
