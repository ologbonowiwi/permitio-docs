<p className="intro-paragraph">Working with the Permit.io Node.js SDK enables developers to seamlessly integrate robust authorization management into
their applications. This SDK simplifies the implementation of fine-grained access controls, whether you're managing user roles with
[RBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rbac/overview), policies with [ABAC](/how-to/build-policies/abac/overview), relationships with
[ReBAC](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/overview), or making use of other powerful Permit features like [Elements](/embeddable-uis/overview). </p>

:::note Prerequisites:
This tutorial is for users who have already set up at least one policy in Permit.io. If you haven't done so yet,
please refer to [this guide](/quickstart) first.
:::

## Adding the Permit.io Node SDK to your project

### 1. Install the Permit.io SDK

To start, you need to install the Permit.io SDK in your project. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
npm install permitio
```

This will add the Permit.io SDK to your project, allowing you to integrate authorization management seamlessly.

### 2. Import the SDK into your code

After installing the SDK, you need to import it into your application.

```javascript
import { Permit } from "permitio";
```

### 3. Create a new Instance of the SDK

Next, create a new Permit object instance of the Permit SDK. You'll need a secret API key, which you can obtain by following the instructions
provided in the setup section of the Permit.io documentation.

```javascript
// This first line initializes the SDK and connects your Node.js app
// to the Permit.io PDP container you've set up in the previous step.
const permit = new Permit({
  // your API Key
  token: "[YOUR_API_KEY]",

  // in production, you might need to change this url to fit your deployment
  pdp: "http://localhost:7766",

  // if you want the SDK to emit logs, uncomment this:
  // log: {
  //   level: "debug",
  // },

  // The SDK returns false if you get a timeout / network error
  // if you want it to throw an error instead, and let you handle this, uncomment this:
  // throwOnError: true,
});
```

Replace **`YOUR_API_KEY`** with the actual API key you obtained. Find instructions how to fetch your API
key [here](/overview/connecting-your-app#1-get-your-permit-environment-api-key).

## The SDK enforcement functionality - Checking for permissions

`permit.check()` is the fundamental SDK function that controls the permissions enforcement in your application code. It acts as a guard of who
can do what, based on the policy that you defined.

:::tip
If you would like to learn more about the `permit.check()` function, and how it works with different policy models, you can read
more about it [here](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check).
:::

You can run a permission check with permit.check(), passing in 3 arguments:

- `user`: a unique string id or object that identifies the user performing the action.
- `action`: the action performed.
- `resource`: the resource (object) the action is performed on. Can be a string or an object.

:::tip
The check function can accept various arguments beyond the `user` and `resource`. For more detailed information on these arguments,
please refer to the main [check page documentation](/how-to/enforce-permissions/check).
:::

In the following example we are checking that a user with the unique id `john@smith.com` can `read` a `document`.

```javascript
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "read", "document");

if (permitted) {
  console.log("John is PERMITTED to read a document");
} else {
  console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to read a document");
}
```

## Other API configuration functionality with the SDK

In this quickstart, we'll introduce you to some core Permit.io functionality using the SDK. As you'll see, the SDK is designed to
be simple and logical, making it easy to develop and manage policies.

### Creating a resource

A resource is the fundamental building block of a policy. It's what the user can interact with. It could be a 'document', a 'building'
or even a 'patient health record'.

```javascript
await permit.api.resource.create({
  key: "repository",
  name: "Repository",
  actions: {
    clone: {},
    push: {},
    view: {},
  },
});
```

### Creating a new role with permissions

A role defines a set of resources and the specific actions a user can perform on those resources. A user can only perform these
actions if they have been assigned the corresponding role.

````javascript
await permit.api.roles.create({
    key: "manager",
    name: "Manager",
    permissions: [
      "repository:clone",
      "repository:view",
    ],
  });```
````

### Syncing a user to Permit

The sync user function allows you to take an existing user from your authentication solution, and add them inside of Permit.

```javascript
await permit.api.syncUser({
  key: "key",
  email: "example@permit.io",
  first_name: "John",
  last_name: "Smith",
  attributes: {},
});
```

### Assigning a role

A role assignment, as the name suggests, assigns a specific role with defined permissions to a user identity. This role assignment
is specific to a particular tenant.

```javascript
await permit.api.roleAssignments.assign({
  user,
  role,
  tenant: "default",
  resource_instance: "document:1",
});
```

functions available per language.

  <Hr />
</Container>

## Working with the full SDK specification

Congratulations on completing the Quickstart guide for Node.js SDK! By now, you should have a solid understanding of the basics,
including setting up your environment, making your first API calls, and handling common tasks.

To further enhance your skills and explore the full capabilities of the Node.js SDK, we highly recommend referring to the
comprehensive Node.js SDK [reference documentation](https://permitio.github.io/permit-node/classes/Permit.html). There, you will
find detailed information on all available methods, classes, and advanced usage scenarios that can help you make the most out of
the SDK in your projects.
