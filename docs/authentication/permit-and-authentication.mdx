## Authentication & Authorization — Better Together

**Authentication (AuthN)** is the process of verifying user identity—confirming users are who they claim to be through credentials, Single Sign-On (SSO), or multi-factor authentication (MFA).

**Authorization (AuthZ)** determines what authenticated users can do within your application. While authentication establishes identity, authorization controls access based on that identity.

A secure system requires both working in harmony:
- Authentication verifies identity but doesn't define permissions
- Authorization enforces permissions but requires verified identities
- Together, they create a complete security model

Permit.io bridges these systems by seamlessly integrating with any authentication provider you already use, while adding powerful, policy-driven authorization that scales with your application.

## Integrating AuthN with Permit.io

After completing AuthN there must be a **handoff** to AuthZ. Permit.io facilitates this transition by ensuring that the authorization system has the most up-to-date user and role information at all times.

To achieve this, there are multiple ways to sync user data between AuthN and AuthZ:

- **Live & In-Line Sync:**
  - After authentication, call `syncUser()` to update Permit.io with the latest user attributes and roles.
  - Alternatively, pass the JWT payload as attributes in `permit.check()` to dynamically include user details in access decisions.

- **Pre-Sync (Backend Sync):**
  - Use Permit.io's API to pre-sync user data before authorization checks occur.
  - Automate user and role provisioning with SCIM to keep authorization aligned with identity provider updates.

:::tip
Permit.io recommends using `syncUser()` immediately after AuthN for most architectures. However, depending on how roles are assigned and managed, other strategies may be more appropriate. Whether you use a live sync approach, backend synchronization, or a combination of both, Permit.io ensures your AuthZ policies remain accurate and up-to-date.
:::

When it comes to AuthN, Permit.io provides the flexability to:
- Connect to any existing authentication provider utilizing the concept of "the handoff point"
- Synchronize users and roles via SCIM or API

- [Entra ID](/integrations/SCIM/EntraID)
- [Okta](/integrations/SCIM/OKTA)
- [Keycloak](https://www.permit.io/blog/implementing-dynamic-keycloak-rbac-with-permitio)
- [Use your own authentication](/authentication/your-authentication/)


**Compatible with All Authentication Standards:**
- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- SAML
- WS-Fed
- Headers
- mTLS

**Universal Compatibility:**
Whether you use a commercial identity provider, an open-source solution, or a custom authentication system, Permit.io's authorization layer will integrate with it through our flexible handoff mechanisms.

## Choosing the Right Approach for AuthN-Managed Roles
Authentication verifies identity, but **where should roles and policies be managed?**

Permit.io offers multiple approaches to role management, each with its own benefits depending on your needs.

### **Approach 1: AuthN-Managed Roles (IdP-Managed)**
- **Best For:** Centralized enterprise access, SCIM-based role provisioning
- **How It Works:** Roles are assigned in an identity provider (IdP) and synced with Permit.io for enforcement.
- **Pros:** Simplifies role assignment with centralized IT management.
- **Cons:** Limited flexibility for dynamic permissions, no support for ReBAC.

### **Approach 2: Application-Managed Roles (Permit.io-Managed)**
- **Best For:** Multi-tenant SaaS apps, dynamic access control
- **How It Works:** Roles are created and managed within Permit.io, allowing for granular, flexible access control.
- **Pros:** Supports dynamic and contextual access control, ReBAC, and custom role management.
- **Cons:** Requires user sync and structured role assignment.

### **Approach 3: Hybrid AuthN & Permit.io Role Management**
- **Best For:** Organizations that need both centralized role management and flexible application-level access control.
- **How It Works:** IT manages high-level roles in the IdP, while Permit.io refines access with fine-grained policies.
- **Pros:** Combines IT governance with application-specific control.
- **Cons:** Requires clear role handoff mechanisms between IT and application owners.

## How AuthN & Permit.io Work Together

<TimelineWrapper>
  <TimelineStep>
    <h3>User Logs In</h3>
    <p>Identity Provider (IdP) or authentication system authenticates the user.</p>
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep>
    <h3>Permit.io Syncs User Info</h3>
    <p>Users & roles are synced via <code>syncUser()</code> to keep AuthZ policy data up-to-date.</p>
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep>
    <h3>Permit.io Applies Policy Enforcement</h3>
    <p>Decisions are based on roles, attributes, and relationships.</p>
  </TimelineStep>

  <TimelineStep>
    <h3>Access is Granted or Denied</h3>
    <p>Enforcement happens via a Permit.io SDK, API Gateways AuthZ integration, or direct PDP API call.</p>
  </TimelineStep>
</TimelineWrapper>


## Why This Works
- Clearly separates AuthN vs. AuthZ responsibilities.
- Helps teams choose the best role management approach for their needs.
- Provides an overview while linking to deeper, technical content.
- Ensures alignment with SCIM-based provisioning, API-based sync, and dynamic role assignment.
